- **Current Position** AI Researh Engineer
- **Research Area** 2D/3D Pose Estimation, Object Detection, Human Action Recognition, Image Classification, Avatar & 3D Reconstruction, Object Tracking, Object Segmentation, TensorRT Optimizer, Model Deployment, ... :bowtie:


### Work Experience
- **KT** (2018.12 ~ Current)
- Institute of Convergence Technology (Seoul, South Korea)
- AI Research Engineer

- **KETI** (2018.07 ~ 2018.12)
- Human Care System Research Center (Seongnam, South Korea)
- Computer Vision Engineer 


### Projects
## KT
Developed **AI technologies** using Python and Pytorch, and deployed a model using ONNX and TensorRT.
- Developed AI traffic solution for [C-ITS](https://fb.watch/7QwYeD7uM0/) including robust object detectors, a Pedestrian Detection System, a Vehicle Detection System, etc. **(2020 ~ Current)**
- Developed "helmet-wearing detection" issues by researching and developing a human detector, a pose estimator, and a helmet classifier. **(2021 ~ Current)**
- Researched and developed human detecting, pose estimating, and action/object classifying technologies to perfect GiGAeyes Pro’s "Fall Down" solution and develop "Action Recognition" solutions for businesses. **(2019 ~ 2020)**

## Personal Projects
Started a personal project to develop skills with interest in **3D Pose Estimation** and **Action Recognition**.
- The use of 2D Pose Estimation for action recognition has many difficulties due to the Occlusion Problem. Therefore, [3D Pose Estimation](https://tv.kakao.com/v/418252402) was attempted. In order to solve the jitter, the noise was minimized by filtering the pose. **(2020.12)**
- Developed a [counting system](https://tv.kakao.com/v/420103143) by classifying push up/down motions based on 2D & 3D pose estimation. **(2021.05)**

## KETI
Developed computer vision algorithms using C++ in an Linux environment.
- Developed a "Skin Lesion Recognition" algorithm by developing hair removal and mole detection functions. **(2018)**
- Developed a capture program using FLIR’s Spinnaker camera firmware library. **(2018)**

## Kyonggi University (Graphics & Image Processing Lab)
Developed several computer vision algorithms using the OpenCV library and C++.
- A binocular image-based, moving object detection and tracking system for a CCTV environment. **(2016 ~ 2018)**
- A machine vision based LED panel defect detection system. **(2017 ~ 2018)**
- An automatic pest-counting system, based on image analysis with Cesco Co., Ltd. **(2016)**


### Skills
- Language **Python, C/C++**
- Library **Pytorch, TensorRT, OpenCV, DeepStream, TensorFlow, TensorFlow Lite**
- Etc. **ONNX, CUDA, ...**
