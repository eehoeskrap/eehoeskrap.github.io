### Work Experience
**KT (Seoul, South Korea)** 
- 2018.12 ~ Current 🏃‍♀️
- Institute of Convergence Technology 
- **AI Research Engineer**

**KETI (Seongnam, South Korea)**
- 2018.07 ~ 2018.12
- Human Care System Research Center
- **Computer Vision Engineer**







### Projects
##### 📌 KT
Developed **AI technologies** using Python and Pytorch, and deployed a model using ONNX and TensorRT.
- Developed AI traffic solution for [C-ITS](https://fb.watch/7QwYeD7uM0/) including robust object detectors, a Pedestrian Detection System, a Vehicle Detection System, etc. **(2020 ~ Current)**
- Developed "helmet-wearing detection" issues by researching and developing a human detector, a pose estimator, and a helmet classifier. **(2021 ~ Current)**
- Researched and developed human detecting, pose estimating, and action/object classifying technologies to develop "Action Recognition" solutions for businesses. **(2019 ~ 2020)**

##### 📌 Personal Projects
Started a personal project to develop skills with interest in **3D Pose Estimation** and **Action Recognition**.
- The use of 2D Pose Estimation for action recognition has many difficulties due to the Occlusion Problem. Therefore, [3D Pose Estimation](https://tv.kakao.com/v/418252402) was attempted. In order to solve the jitter, the noise was minimized by filtering the pose. **(2020.12)**
- Developed a [counting system](https://tv.kakao.com/v/420103143) by classifying push up/down motions based on 2D & 3D pose estimation. **(2021.05)**

##### 📌 KETI
Developed computer vision algorithms using C++ in an Linux environment.
- Developed a "Skin Lesion Recognition" algorithm by developing hair removal and mole detection functions. **(2018)**
- Developed a capture program using FLIR’s Spinnaker camera firmware library. **(2018)**

##### 📌 Kyonggi University, Graphics & Image Processing Lab
Developed several computer vision algorithms using the OpenCV library and C++.
- A binocular image-based, moving object detection and tracking system for a CCTV environment. **(2016 ~ 2018)**
- A machine vision based LED panel defect detection system. **(2017 ~ 2018)**
- An automatic pest-counting system, based on image analysis with Cesco Co., Ltd. **(2016)**







### Skills
